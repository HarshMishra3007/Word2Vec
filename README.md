# Word2Vec

Downloaded the pretrained set of Word2Vec vectors from https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM

Task 1				
Assigned each word in each phrase a Word2Vec embedding.				

Task 2

Batch execution: Calculate L2 distance (Euclidean distance) or Cosine distance of each phrase to all other phrases and store results. Try to achieve this in a manner that is not compute or memory wasteful. Note that the whole phrase vector can be approximated by normalized sum of all the individual word tokens embeddings.	

Task 3

On the fly execution: Create a function that takes any string, e.g. user-input phrase, and finds and return the closest match from phrases in phrases.csv and the distance				
				
Structure your code into modules. Use OOP programming principles. Prepare setup.py or project.toml, prepare pip or conda environment. Initialize logging. Add some error handling and argument validations.
